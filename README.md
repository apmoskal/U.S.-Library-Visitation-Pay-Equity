# U.S.-Library-Visitation-Pay-Equity
Prepared the 2022 Public Libraries Survey (n ≈ 9K libraries) with outlier handling, locale features, and average salary-per-FTE measures. • Fit regression models (with diagnostics) to relate Wi-Fi, programs, and open hours to visits by locale and joined IRS ZIP code income data to assess staff pay equity.
